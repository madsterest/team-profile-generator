 # Description
 
 This application allows the user to generate a clean and professional website displaying helpful information about their teams employees.
 This process takes the hassel out of creating a polished website and can be customised depending on the needs of the team. The website also has clickable links to the teams email, so the users preffered mail service will open allowing for easy communication with the team memebers.
 This program is created dynamically so it can easily adjust to any number of team members or roles. The rendered page is polished and clean as well as being responsive.
